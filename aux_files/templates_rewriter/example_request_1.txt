APT40  used  MURKYSHELL  at  a  compromised  victim  organization  to  port  scan  IP  addresses  and  conduct  network  enumeration. APT40  frequently  uses  native  Windows  commands,  such  as  net.exe,  to  conduct  internal  reconnaissance  of  a  victim’s  environment. Web  shells  are  heavily  relied  on  for  nearly  all  stages  of  the  attack  lifecycle. Internal  web  servers  are  often  not  configured  with  the  same  security  controls  as  public-facing  counterparts,  making  them  more  vulnerable  to  exploitation  by  APT40  and  similarly  sophisticated  groups.
