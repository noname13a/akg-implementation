Process of section summary: For each tactic, if there is relevant content in the CTI report, extract and rewrite the related content in chronological order as detailed as possible. If there is no relevant content, skip that tactic and output "None" as the summary. Key information, including the names of entities and the relationships of relations related to the subordinate techniques for given tactic, needs to be preserved in the rewriting process.
