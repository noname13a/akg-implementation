Between July 18 and 25, 2011, the attackers modified the server to distribute a trojaned update file to SK Communications computers during routine checks for software updates. This trojaned update file contained the malware 'Backdoor.Agent.Hza', which subsequently infected over 60 SK Communications computers.",

The malware communicated with a command and control server located at the South Korean IP address 116.127.121.41 on TCP port 8080. The attackers also installed additional malware named 'nateon.exe' on at least one of the infected computers, which was used to access the user databases.",
